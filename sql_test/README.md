SQL Exercise
------------

Given a final table name _**use\_case\_predictions**_ in a relational DB (SQL based), with the following columns:

*   **record\_id**: string

*   **score**: string (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)

*   **first\_prediction\_date**: date

*   **last\_prediction\_date**: date

*   **close\_date**: date _nullable_

*   **status**: string (Success, Fail) _nullable_


You can assume:

*   The use-case pipeline runs once a day (start and end within the same day)

*   The data is updated (atomic) at the end of a successful run 

*   [Data setup](./data.sql)

*   You use the following SQL web tool - Fiddle [https://www.db-fiddle.com/](https://www.db-fiddle.com/) 


**Provide an SQL queriesÂ  that calculate:**


1.  Number of predicted records in the last run (that had predictions)

2.  AVG daily **new**, in last 90 days from last run

    *  How will you handle days with no new records

    *  You can assume you have a table with all calendar days (_**calendar\_days(day:date)**_)

3.  AVG time to convert, in last 90 days from last run

4.  Sum outdated record (records that were stopped being predicted, and should have closed already)

5.  Calculate the last 14 days accumulated SUCCESS performance, per day, for each day in the last 7 days, based on the close\_date .

    *Performance = count(score in (Excellent, Good) and status=Success) / count(status=Success)

**Bonus**: consider Qs #3 and #4 different calculator for Success (Excellent + Good) and Fail (Fair + Poor)
